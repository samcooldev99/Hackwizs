## üî• Your Pitch
In present scenario market is really down. Small businesses like kirana shops and garages in India face critical issues like financial and in technical fields. So as these shopkeepers or owners won't be having good financial background to pickup high amount of loan. As lenders presently charge very high amount of interest and the amount they are investing is also not coming with any guarantee. Our solution KIVA mostly target towards these key problems faced by a normal person everyday by targeting the main audience as the "lenders" . In order to solve these issues we first try to collect the information about the company or lender with the following content :

1. Business name,owner name and services provided. 
2. Business details: Address and GSTIN, in order to verify if the company is legit or not using Azure cognitive services.
3. Business sales history in order to do analysis and computation on sales history report and compare it to benchmark and if the score is good, the lender's details will be updated on our platform.

In order to make it easier for the SMBs we created a portal named as KIVA, where both SMBs and lenders can register and check the trusted lenders as per there business requirements. So, in order to assure there investment we act as an intermediate through this portal by providing them the good quality products and minimizing the risk factors.

On the other hand, the lenders at there side of portal can see there daily performance and stats of there clients.
